Speedtest: Performance Measurement Application
----------------------------------------------

You can use these source to create a Round2 performance measurement
application. Simply follow these steps:

1. Put these file together with the source files from
   the Round2 implementation you want to test.

2. Edit the api.h and pst_api.h files to set up the parameter sets and
   A creation variant to use for testing.

3. Compile using e.g.:

    gcc -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer *.c -lcrypto -lkeccak -lm -o speedtest

4. Run the tests, optionally specifying the number times the tests
   need to be repeated (-r N):

   ./speedtest
